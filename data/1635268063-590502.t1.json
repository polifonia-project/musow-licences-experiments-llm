We encourage\ninterested users to send comments on usability to <a href=\"http://www.music.indiana.edu/variations/comment.html\">varia@dlib.indiana.edu</a> to help us in our ongoing\ndevelopment of the project.\n\n<p>Due to the early developmental status of this phase of VARIATIONS, we\nwill not be able to guarantee continued availability of this resource or any\nof its components.  We value comments for their help in future development,\nbut will not necessarily be able to make changes to the prototype\ninterfaces at this time.\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/variations/scores/scores.html\">\nOnline scores: Opera Literature</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Selected opera scores chosen from the Cook Music Library's holdings\n<li>Scores are in the public domain\n<li>Available from anywhere\n<li>Designed to be viewed on a 17-inch monitor with a screen resolution of 1024 x 768\n<li>Designed primarily for online display, not for printing.  \n</li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/variations/scores/song.html\">\nOnline scores: Song Literature</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Selected scores chosen from the Cook Music Library's holdings\n<li>Scores are in the public domain\n<li>Available from anywhere\n<li>Designed to be viewed on a 17-inch monitor with a screen resolution of 1024x 768\n<li>Designed primarily for online display, not for printing.\n</li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/variations/scores/symphonic.html\">\nOnline scores: Orchestral and Choral Literature</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Selected scores chosen from the Cook Music Library's holdings\n<li>Scores are in the public domain\n<li>Available from anywhere\n<li>Designed to be viewed on a 17-inch monitor with a screen resolution of 1024\nx 768\n<li>Designed primarily for online display, not for printing.\n</li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/variations/scores/chamber.html\">\nOnline scores: Chamber Music Literature</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Selected scores chosen from the Cook Music Library's holdings\n<li>Scores are in the public domain\n<li>Available from anywhere\n<li>Designed to be viewed on a 17-inch monitor with a screen resolution of 1024\nx 768\n<li>Designed primarily for online display, not for printing.\n</li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/variations/scores/piano.html\">\nOnline scores: Piano Literature</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Selected scores chosen from the Cook Music Library's holdings\n<li>Scores are in the public domain\n<li>Available from anywhere\n<li>Designed to be viewed on a 17-inch monitor with a screen resolution of 1024\n x 768\n<li>Designed primarily for online display, not for printing.\n</li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/variations/scores/soloinstr.html\">\nOnline scores: Solo Instrumental Literature</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Selected scores chosen from the Cook Music Library's holdings\n<li>Scores are in the public domain\n<li>Available from anywhere\n<li>Designed to be viewed on a 17-inch monitor with a screen resolution of 1024\n x 768\n<li>Designed primarily for online display, not for printing.\n</li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/variations/scores/mlonly/M525/opera2.html\">Online\nscores and sound recordings</a></h3> <ul>\n<li>Available only on Windows-based computers within the William and Gayle Cook Music Library\n<li>Includes selected opera scores from the public domain with matching online sound recordings from the VARIATIONS collection.\n<li>Scores were designed for online viewing and not for printing.
