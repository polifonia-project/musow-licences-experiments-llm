Every manuscript is given in full-colour reproduction and entered with a general description. Fragments are indexed in full. Selected codices with monophonic or polyphonic music are also fully indexed. In a few cases, sources without notation were included for comparative purposes. There are many search capabilities that are immediately available to the visitor. Under Sources, the visitor is able to search for manuscripts according to location, type, and century (single or multiple choice), in addition to more detailed information such as shelf-mark, provenance, type of notation, and other available criteria. Once a manuscript is selected, the researcher is presented with the contents of that source, along with its corresponding images. Under Musical items, the visitor is able to locate specific chants or polyphonic items in the indexed manuscripts, and to search by composer. Under Archives, a list of Iberian collections and libraries are listed using RISM sigla and can be searched.\",\n    \"PEM contents are published under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) licence.\"\n  ]\n}", "error": ""}, {"link": "http://cantus.sk", "response": "{\n  \"copyright\": \"(c) Slovak Early Music Database 2012-2023\",\n  \"licences\": null,\n  \"terms and conditions\": null\n}", "error": ""}]}
