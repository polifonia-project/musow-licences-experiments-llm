It is no longer needed to stringify the JSON objects and the toolkit now takes and return Python dictionaries. Make sure you update your code if you update to the latest version! \n Verovio has now a font fallback when the selected font is missing some glyphs. This fxes problem introduced in the latest release when improving text font support. Another new feature is the control of the log level, with four levels (info, warning, error and debug). Controlling the log level is also available for the Python and the JavaScript binding. \n As always, this release includes many improvements of the rendering output of Verovio. It also includes some new options for controlling the output. See the  <a href=\"https://github.com/rism-digital/verovio/releases/tag/version-3.13.0\">release announcement</a> release announcement  for more details about these. \n \n \n \n <a href=\"news.xhtml\">See all news ...</a> See all news ... \n \n \n \n \n \n            Verovio is developed by the  <a href=\"https://rism.digital/\" target=\"_blank\">RISM Digital Center</a> RISM Digital Center  with the support of the Swiss National Science Foundation. The project receives dedicated financial support from the Digital Mozart Edition, a joint project of the Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation and the Packard Humanities Institute, Los Altos/CA.

Rome in the late sixteenth century. He was one of the very first to use engraving on copper plates for printing music, a technique that was revealed to be the most suited to music about one century later.\n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"}
