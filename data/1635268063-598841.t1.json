The increasing financial difficulties of traditional printed \npublication models call for the creation of such a system, both for the long-term \ncontinuation of scholarly edition production and for the availability of musicological \nresearch results to a broad audience. Through a \"freeware\" approach to components \n(both software and musical data), the project is aimed specifically at removing \neconomic and cultural barriers which often keep scholarly music editions within \nuniversity boundaries, out of easy reach for most non-specialist users.\n</p>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\nEase of distribution and financial advantages, however, are by no means the only or \neven the most important motivations behind electronic editions. For centuries, the \nphysical characteristics of printed books have subtly shaped our understanding and \nstructuring of written information. Now with the advent of modern information \ntechnology - multimedia, hyperlinked structures, semantic data markup - our reliance \non traditional publication models is diminishing daily. Electronic editions are not \nprinted books, and they need not be bound by the same physical constraints. They \nshould be configurable, searchable, susceptible to analyses which are prohibitively \ntime-consuming or impossible with a simple printed text. The reader should be able \nto look at texts and music in whichever format is most appropriate to the moment.\n</p>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\nWithout the need for a single fixed visual form on a printed page, a computerized \nedition system can utilize one editor's transcription to create any number of visual \nforms and variant versions. The result is an entirely new form of critical music edition \nin which dynamically generated, user-configured formats remove the unwieldiness of \nmultiple printed editions, replacing it with the concept of multiple states of a single \nedition. The early music editor's task returns to the truly critical aspects of \ninterpreting the text, rather than the ultimately unsatisfactory process of making \npresentation decisions which must limit the usability of the edition.\n</p>\n<p class=\"HomeAnchor\"><a href=\"#TopMenu\">Top</a></p>\n<br/>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\n<b><a name=\"EPMD\">Edition projects and \"meta-data\"</a></b>\n</p>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\nConceptualizing the CMME specifically as an electronic publication system, rather \nthan a typical \"database,\" calls for a different set of expectations and modes of \ninteraction. The music editions which populate the CMME corpus do not represent an \nanonymous mass of information punched in by disinterested data-entry workers; these \nare fresh editions, produced from primary source materials by musicological experts \nand kept at a high standard by our international board of editorial advisors. The reader \nof Shakespeare or Chaucer expects an edition which has been prepared with great care \nand knowledge acquired through study and experience, as does the performer of \nLassus motets. There is no reason to waive these same requirements in online editorial \nendeavors.\n</p>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\nThese principles of scholarly arbitration and peer review remain an important element \nin the formation of CMME \"Editorial Projects.\" Corresponding in many ways to a \nvolume in a printed edition series, an editorial project gathers up a collection of \nrelated compositions to be presented under the guidance of one editor or editorial \ngroup - for example, the contents of a single manuscript, the complete works of one \ncomposer, or a set of pieces known to come from a single court or city. As with any \npublication of early materials built on sound scholarly standards, a CMME edition \nprovides the user with an introduction by the music's editors illuminating the \nhistorical, musical, and analytical context of the edition's contents. The web pages for \nindividual compositions offer further commentary specific to each work.\n</p>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\nBeyond the set of editorial projects, however, users will quickly encounter a wider \narray of information in the Database section concerning musical sources, composers, \nand compositions which are not yet represented by music editions in the CMME. This \nnetwork of contextual information - \"meta-data,\" because it is not the music data \nitself, but rather a set of data about that data - allows readers to explore the broader \nenvironment of the music editions in the corpus. Which other works are contained in \nthe same sources? Who are the composers represented therein? The CMME meta-data \ncollection limits itself largely to the one major element which is missing from the \nstandard reference works on 15th- and 16th-century sources: the listing of actual \ncontents, giving the names and composers of all compositions and their locations in \nthe sources. More detailed forms of meta-data about compositions and manuscripts \nare available from the \n<a href=\"http://www.arts.ufl.edu/motet/default.asp\">Motet Online database</a>, the \n<a href=\"http://193.52.215.193/Ricercar/newvers/basechanson/03231-1.htm\">Base chanson</a>, \nand <a href=\"http://www.diamm.ac.uk/\">DIAMM</a>, for those who wish to \nexplore further, and soon this information will form part of a large centralized data \npool. Plans are in the works for the institution of a large-scale cooperative effort \nbetween the CMME, Base chanson, DIAMM, and Motet Online projects for the creation of a shared \nmeta-data repository upon which each project can draw with its own goals and \ninterfaces.\n</p>\n<p class=\"HomeAnchor\"><a href=\"#TopMenu\">Top</a></p>\n<br/>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\n<b><a name=\"Structure\">Structure</a></b>\n</p>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\nEncompassing all of the stages in the online publishing process, from initial \ntranscription to final distribution, the CMME acts as a complete system composed of \nthe following elements:\n</p>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tr>\n<td>Format</td>\n<td>Early music representation grammar (XML-based markup language, .cmme.xml)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Software</td>\n<td>\nMusic editor (Java-based transcription tool)<br/>\nMusic viewer (Java-based score-viewing program)<br/>\nWeb-accessible database of scores and information on \nsources/composers/etc. (\"meta-data\")\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Data</td>\n<td>Music repository (<i>corpus</i> of transcriptions)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\nKnowledge of the details of the CMME representation format (the way the scores are \nstructured and stored electronically) is entirely unnecessary in order to use the system. \nExperts in both musicology and information retrieval, however, will recognize the \nusefulness of having musical score data available in the transparent, human-readable \nformat offered by XML markup, which puts CMME scores at the disposition even of \nusers who do not wish to employ our software. The formal specification is publicly \navailable (in XML Schema) <a href=\"data/music/cmme.xsd\">here</a>, but this scheme is subject to change without notice \nduring the current development phase (particularly as we modify the format to include \ndifferent dialects of mensural notation). When the format has reached a stable state in \n2009, a more verbose description of the standard will be made public.\n</p>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\nThe Java programs for creating and viewing scores offer users the advantages of a \nstraightforward, platform-independent software experience. To view the scores in the \nonline CMME repository, there is no need to install any special software from us; any \nmodern web browser with support for Java applets (including the current versions of \nInternet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari) will handle the software automatically, whether \nrunning under Windows, MacOS, Unix, etc. For those who wish to create their own \nscores with the CMME Editor tool, a beta version may be obtained by contacting the \ndevelopers. After the current period of interface development and user-feedback \nanalysis, a more finalized version of the CMME Editor will be made directly available for \ndownload on this site. Eventually the entire source code and specifications of the \nprograms will be accessible under an open source licence.\n</p>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\nThe web interface is intended to provide simple, unrestricted access to our collection \nof music editions, while situating these in a broader manuscript/print context to \nfacilitate exploration of source materials. As mentioned <a href=\"#EPMD\">above</a>, the CMME repository \nof meta-data (contents listings of manuscripts, biographical information on \ncomposers, contextual historical information on compositions, etc.) will soon form \npart of a large multi-project dataset shared with DIAMM, the Motet Online Database, and \nthe Base chanson. Each project has its own needs, and provides different modes of presenting \nand manipulating this underlying information. As far as the CMME is concerned, an \nuncomplicated and easily-understood interface will remain in place to guide users to \nthe project's key element: our music transcriptions. Created by scholars and musicians \nwho are professional-level experts in the repertories of their specific Editorial \nProjects, these are the first online early music editions truly compatible with the \ndemands of 21st-century publication.\n</p>\n<p class=\"HomeAnchor\"><a href=\"#TopMenu\">Top</a></p>\n<br/>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\n<b><a name=\"ABH\">A brief history</a></b>\n</p>\n<table cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"100%\">\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td><p class=\"textinfo\">1999</p></td>\n<td><p class=\"textinfo\">\nThe CMME Project was initiated by Theodor Dumitrescu as an \nundergraduate honors thesis in the Department of Computer Science at \nPrinceton University, under the supervision of Perry Cook and Peter \nJeffery.

Development work on the software and system infrastructure is supported \nthrough academic grants, and music-editing work is carried out by individual scholars \non a project-by-project basis. We feel that restricting access to electronic resources by \ncharging individuals and institutions significantly reduces the social utility of online \ninformation distribution.\n</p>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\n<a name=\"FAQq4\"><i>How can I contribute editions to the database?</i></a><br/>\nThe CMME Advisory Board is responsible for deciding which editions are of a \nsuitable scholarly standard to enter the public repository. Our transcriptions are all \nproduced from primary sources by experts in the chosen repertories. If you wish to \nsubmit a proposal for an edition project, please <a href=\"/contact\">contact</a> us for further details.\n</p>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\n<a name=\"FAQq5\"><i>Why do you have listings for manuscripts and compositions which have not yet been \nedited for the CMME database?</i></a><br/>\nThe idea of including meta-data for a much wider array of works than has currently \nbeen edited is to facilitate the user's exploration of the source context of works which \nthey would normally encounter as isolated scores. See the discussion <a href=\"#EPMD\">above</a>.\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i>Features</i></p>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\n<a name=\"FAQq10\"><i>What are the next features to be added to the system?</i></a><br/>\nA wide array of new capabilities is envisioned for the future development of the \nCMME system. At the current moment, the extensions and features we're working on \ninclude the following:<br/>\n* Options for score visualization in fully modern notation<br/>\n* Individualized online user workspaces<br/>\n* Automated music/incipit searching<br/>\n</p>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\n<a name=\"FAQq6\"><i>Will feature X or Y be introduced in the future?</i></a><br/>\nThis is the most common set of questions received about the CMME. The potential of \ncomputerized editions to offer new modes of interaction with musical materials is \nnearly limitless, and understandably many users have ideas for new elements they \nwould like to see introduced. Our current development schedule has set in place a \nbroad outline of features to be created through 2009, but individual ideas are always \nwelcome; simply use the <a href=\"/contact\">feedback</a> form on this site.\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i>Technical issues</i></p>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\n<a name=\"FAQq7\"><i>Do I need to install special software to view CMME editions?</i></a><br/>\nIn most cases, no. Modern web browsers with built-in support for <a href=\"http://java.com/\">Java</a> applets will \nopen the CMME Viewer automatically when you click on a \"View score\" link. \nOtherwise, you will need to download and install Sun's \n<a href=\"http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp\">Java runtime system</a> for use \nwith your web browser.\n</p>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\n<a name=\"FAQq8\"><i>What format do you use for storing the musical data of CMME editions? Are the \nformal specifications publicly available?</i></a><br/>\nThe CMME format is a dialect of <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/XML/\">XML</a> tailored \nspecifically to representing music \nin mensural notation (and converting it automatically to various forms of modern \nnotation). The formal specification is available <a href=\"data/music/cmme.xsd\">here</a> \nin XML Schema, but as mentioned <a href=\"#Structure\">above</a>, this format will \nbe changing without notice over the next few years.\n</p>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">\n<a name=\"FAQq9\"><i>Can I download the score files to view/analyze on my own computer?</i></a><br/>\nThe XML file (.cmme.xml) for every score is available on the database page for that \nindividual composition, through the link entitled \"XML score data.\" To obtain a \nstandalone application version of the CMME Viewer (for viewing score files from \nyour local filesystem, rather than our website), please <a href=\"/contact\">contact</a> us.\n</p>\n<p class=\"HomeAnchor\"><a href=\"#TopMenu\">Top</a></p>\n<hr/>\n<br/>\n<h2><a href=\"/database\">Consult the score database.</a></h2>\n<br/>\n<p class=\"textinfo\">The CMME Project is not associated in any way with the printed series \n<i>Corpus Mensurabilis Musicae</i>, the American Institute of Musicology, or A-R \nEditions. It is a research project funded in the past by organizations in France and \nthe Netherlands, and currently housed at Utrecht University.</p>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tr>\n<td width=\"33%\">\n<div align=\"left\">\n<a href=\"http://www.nwo.nl/\"><img alt=\"NWO\" border=\"0\" src=\"maingfx/nwologo.gif\"/></a>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\">\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.uu.nl/\"><img alt=\"Universiteit Utrecht\" border=\"0\" src=\"maingfx/uulogo.gif\"/></a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.surffoundation.nl/\"><img alt=\"SURFfoundation\" border=\"0\" src=\"maingfx/surflogo.gif\"/></a><br/>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\">\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer\"><img alt=\"Valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional\" height=\"31\" src=\"http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10\" width=\"88\"/></a>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table></td>\n<td style=\"background: url(/maingfx/bgline-rcol.gif);\" width=\"50\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"50\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"75\" src=\"/maingfx/bgline-botlcorner.gif\" width=\"50\"/></td>\n<td> </td>\n<td width=\"50\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"75\" src=\"/maingfx/bgline-botrcorner.gif\" width=\"50\"/></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n</html>\n"}
