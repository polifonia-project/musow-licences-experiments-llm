{"response": "I'm sorry, but I cannot retrieve the HTML code from the provided address. However, I can provide you with a general approach to find links to licenses, privacy policies, or terms of use in HTML code.\n\nTypically, such links can be found in the footer section of a webpage or in a dedicated \"Legal\" or \"Policies\" page. You can use a web scraping tool or parse the HTML code manually to search for anchor tags (`<a>`) that contain keywords like \"license,\" \"privacy,\" or \"terms.\" Here is an example of how you can search for these links using Python:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\nurl = \"https://example.com\"  # Replace with the actual URL\n\nresponse = requests.get(url)\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n\nlinks = []\n\n# Find links containing keywords\nkeywords = [\"license\", \"privacy\", \"terms\"]\nfor link in soup.find_all('a'):\n    href = link.get('href')\n    if any(keyword in href.lower() for keyword in keywords):\n        links.append(href)\n\n# Return maximum 3 links if available\nresult = {\n    \"links\": links[:3]\n}\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nPlease provide the correct HTML code or a specific webpage link, and I will be happy to assist you further by using the provided details.", "webpage": "https://archive.org/details/digitalfanzinepreservationsociety?&sort=-week&page=2", "htmlcode": "504 Gateway Time-out \nThe server didn't respond in time.\n"}
