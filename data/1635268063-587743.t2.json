Harvested metadata about sheet music in participating collections is hosted by UCLA Digital Library Program, which provides an access service via this metadata to sheet music records at the host libraries. Data providers have chosen to catalog their sheet music in different ways, but a large proportion of the original sheets in participating collections has been digitized, allowing users direct access to the music itself and in many cases covers and advertisements that offer evidence of the cultural context in which the songs were published.\",\n    \"IMLS Support\": \"In 2009, the Institute of Museum and Library Services awarded a National Leadership Grant for the creation of the Next Generation Sheet Music Consortium. The University of California, Los Angeles, and its partner, Indiana University, are developing tools and services to meet the needs of both data providers--libraries, museums, historical societies, and other curators of sheet music collections--and users of sheet music--musicologists, performers, cultural and art historians, etc.--as identified from a needs analysis that was funded by a 2007 planning grant from the IMLS National Leadership Grant program. Tools and services developed in the project will enable institutions with limited technical knowledge to participate in the metadata aggregation service of the Sheet Music Consortium and will provide users with a richer set of services, including the ability to contribute structured metadata to the collection, write annotations, and link to related materials of interest across Consortium collections. In addition, cataloging guidelines and tools will be developed to support and encourage standardized descriptive practices and facilitate merging and downloading of metadata records from the Consortium's Web site.\"\n  },\n  \"licences\": {},\n  \"terms and conditions\": {}\n}", "error": ""}]}
