By committing to and paying for a show, an ensemble has effectively taken it off the market for their submitted schedule for that competitive season. As such, it would not be fair to us or other groups who inquired after the show was purchased for us to provide a refund. Our shows are leased (not purchased, as Visaudio retains ownership) for the duration of one competitive season. If an ensemble leases a show for a season, but decides not to compete that season, you would need to pruchase an additional license for future seasons. The reasoning is very similar to why we do not offer refunds. The show was taken off the market, preventing other units from using it, so a leased but unused show is treated the same as a leased and used how. You have a few options: You can go through a company like Tresona ( http://www.tresonamusic.com ) and handle it through their web-based system, or contacting the publishers directly if they are not exclusively administered by Tresona. Getting these permissions are required before shows with those restrictions will be leased, so it would be wise to get started with that as soon as we\u00a0confirm that a show is available to your ensemble.\"\n}", "error": ""}]}
