Many websites include important links such as \"Terms of Use,\" \"Privacy Policy,\" or \"Legal\" in the footer area of their pages.\n\n2. Check for links or buttons in the header or menu bar of the website. Some websites may have a dedicated section or dropdown menu for legal information.\n\n3. If the website has a search functionality, you can try searching for keywords like \"license,\" \"privacy policy,\" or \"terms of use\" to see if any relevant pages come up.\n\nKeep in mind that the availability and location of legal information can vary from website to website, so it's best to explore different sections of the website, such as About, Contact, or Legal, if available.\n\nI apologize for any inconvenience caused by not being able to analyze the specific HTML code you provided.", "webpage": "http://frescobaldi.music.duke.edu", "htmlcode": "Not Acceptable!
